Creative - Developer Guidelines


Naming convention: camelCase üê´

When targeting multiple selectors on CSS, have them on separate lines:
Example:
selector1, 
selector2, 
selector3, 
selector4 {
    property: value;
property: value;
}

Partials:
setup 
variables 
mixins 
general 
header 
main (can be further broken down into homePage, blogPage, contactPage)
footer
mediaQueries

Color property: Hex and rgba for transparency - #UPPERCASE (ex: #FFF, #FFFFFF)

Commenting guidelines:
Good Example:
/* hello this is a comment haha */ 
selector { 
font-size: 2rem;
background: #555;
color: #000;
}
No comments in the middle of a CSS block


Not Recommended:
selector { 
font-size: 2rem;
/* hello this is a comment haha */
background: #555;
color: #000;
}
